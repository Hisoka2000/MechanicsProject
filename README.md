 Mechanics Project 1 for AUA (Ruben Shahnazaryan)

 For question No 3. 
 With input values speed = 60, positiveAcc = 2.5, negativeAcc = 1.5, distance = 100, width = 15 and duration = 2.3, the car should start decelerating to stop.
 With input values speed = 80, positiveAcc = 3, negativeAcc = 1, distance = 85, width = 10 and duration = 5, the car should accelerate to pass the intersection.
